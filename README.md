Hello, everyone!

Yesterday was the first time I have done any programming since college (roughly 9 years now). I was inspired to look into it again by my neighbor who programs in C# for his work, which he learned independently. Growing up I actually wanted to be a programmer professionally but immaturity in college led me away from that path. I am now at a crossroads in my life where I have sold my business and moved to another state in hopes of starting a new career but have found that more difficult than I imagines. This will be my 3rd month looking for work. I have just now considered the possibility that I may be able to turn to programming as a means of income but if nothing else I can continue to do this as hobby.
